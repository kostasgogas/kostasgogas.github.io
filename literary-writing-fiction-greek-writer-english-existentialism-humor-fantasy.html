<h3>About my Writing</h3>

More or less I'm occupied with existential polar opposites finding a way to become one. This is my personal journey and it reflects on my work.

I'm concerned about the individual struggling to figure out himself by taking into account all his inner impulses and expressing himself in a cohesive whole while being faced with narrow structures of societal expectations.

In my writing you can find existential self-debating, an individualistic approach, nightmares, humor all over it as well as irony, modernism and (in my early writing) streams of consciousness.

Later I would incorporate that story in my first novel, again written in Greek, in the summer of 2008.
